## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r LoadData}
#Read the data and omit NAs.
data = read.csv("activity.csv")

#we want to group the data by date and the summarise by date to get the count
ProData =  na.omit(data %>% group_by(date) %>%
        summarise(sum(steps)))

head(ProData)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
